### Pillboxes

#### How many should I create?
In general, avoid excess production of pillboxes (and defence structures in general).
Later on in the game, it might be OK to produce more defence structures, since
you can sustain the defence production without going broke.

Why would you want to avoid placing defence structures early in the game?

* Placing defence structures costs money, and cash is sparse early game. In
  addition, they drain power, so you would need to produce more power plants
  than otherwise would be necessary if no defence structures were produced.
* In the early game, assuming no macro mistakes and decent army production,
  one player will not have a distinct advantage over another player. So it's
  not really necessary to take precautions and place defence structures. 
* Early game, map control is more important. By placing defence structures,
  you spend money on defence instead of spending in on the army. Everything
  else equal, the opponent may have a bigger army and thus have better chance
  at having map control.

#### Okay, and when would it be nice to place pillboxes?
We have three situations where pillboxes can be very useful.

* **When you expect an attack and need to reinforce**:
